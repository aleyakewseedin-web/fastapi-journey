# - The function should parse the incoming JSON request body to extract the name and role of the new crew member
# - Create a new ID for the new crew member by finding the maximum ID in the database and adding 1, or using 1 if the database is empty
# - Add the new member to the mock database with the new ID
# - Return a JSON response with the new crew member's ID and details
